<strong>Computational simulation in experimental and clinical cardiac electrophysiological research: interactions with novel optical imaging technologies</strong><br></p>
Computational simulation plays an important role in many different aspects of cardiac electrophysiological research, both in terms of direct clinical translation and also in collaboration with basic science experimentalists, particularly with respect to novel optical imaging technologies. In this short talk, I will begin by briefly discussing how modelling can be used in conjunction with the latest advancements in clinical cardiac imaging to help directly guide ablation therapy, stratify patient risk for lethal arrhythmias and optimise electrotherapy devices and protocols. In the main part of the talk, I will then focus on the utility of modelling in experimental cardiac research, providing recent examples of collaborative projects where modelling has been used to further investigate hypotheses, perform controlled parameter sensitivity analysis and provide high resolution 3-dimensional spatial and temporal data on complex phenomena. I will also show examples of modelling-driven projects which have used novel imaging data for essential validation purposes and those which use the high-resolution structural imaging data as a starting point for highly-detailed model creation. Finally, I will briefly introduce the work we have conducted on simulation of the optical imaging process itself, and how this can be used to facilitate interpretation of experimental imaging data and potentially guide novel clinical optical catheter development.</p>

<strong>Cardiotoxicity screening with pig ventricular slices</strong><br></p>
Cardiotoxicity screening is crucial in drug development to reduce risks to patients and economic losses. Different in-vitro approaches have been developed, but they are still lacking normal tissue composition and physiological load. Herein, we explore biomimetic cultivation (BMC) of myocardial slices from healthy pigs as a new cardiotoxicity screening approach. Pig left-ventricular samples were cut into 300 μm thick slices. Slices were pre-stretched by 1.5 mN after installation. The twitch force was recorded during electrical stimulation to determine the force-frequency relationship (FFR), the frequency dependence of contraction duration, the effective refractory period (ERP), and the pacing threshold. Slices generated 2.4 ± 1.4 mN twitch force at 1 Hz electrical pacing and showed a positive FFR, and negative frequency-contraction duration relationship. 300μM Na+ channel blocker lidocaine, increased the pacing threshold by ~300%. The L-type Ca2+ channel activator Bay K8644 (300 nM) increased the twitch force to 295±195% (n=7), while the Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine (100 nM) decreased the force to 21±5.6% (n=9). The hERG K+ channel blocker dofetilide (3 nM) prolonged the ERP and contraction duration to 220±36% and 161±4% (n=5), respectively. The ß-adrenergic receptor and Ikr inhibitor sotalol (10 μM) prolonged the ERP from ~400 ms to ~600 ms, and addition of 1 μM JNJ 303 further prolonged the ERP to ~850ms, suggesting that the Iks current could be detected after blocking Ikr. Late INa could be provoked by 100 nM dofetilide after 12 h treatment, but not by 100 μM moxifloxacin and were identified by the inhibitory action of 10 μM ranolazine. To validate our new approach, we tested five drug candidates selected from the CiPA list as well as acetylsalicylic acid, PBS, and DMSO as controls in a blinded test and we were able to detect all arrhythmic drugs and their specific effects on cardiac electrophysiology.  In conclusion, we established a new approach for cardiotoxicity assessment and demonstrate its efficiency. It can be upscaled to medium throughput screening. Thus, we suggest that our approach can reduce animal numbers and improve the efficiency of preclinical cardiotoxicity screening.</p>

<strong>Correlative super-resolution microscopy for understanding the structural basis of fast, calcium signals in the heart</strong><br></p>
Super-resolution microscopy (SRM) and molecule counting algorithms have advanced our understanding of the clustering properties of membrane proteins like the giant ryanodine receptor (RyR). The positions of RyR channels resolved with these methods have been key enablers for in silico simulations of the intracellular calcium (Ca2+) signals (e.g. Ca2+ sparks, transients or waves) produced by RyRs. In the presented work, we use a recent correlative imaging protocol [1] that experimentally correlates sub-sarcolemmal spontaneous Ca2+  sparks in right ventricular myocytes in rats, recorded with total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, with the underlying sub-sarcolemmal RyR patterns, visualised with the SRM techniques, DNA- point accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (DNA-PAINT). Local examination of the RyR patterns underneath each Ca2+ spark revealed a steep correlation between the size of the Ca2+ sparks and the underlying channel ensembles which typically ranged from ~ 5 to 80 channels. A weaker correlation was observed in right ventricular myocytes isolated from rats with right ventricular failure, reflecting dysfunction in the local regulation of the RyRs in such pathologies. A non-random patterns of Ca2+ sparks featured ‘hot spots’ of distinct sub-cellular regions consisting of recurring spontaneous sparks. Overlay of these regions of high spontaneous activity revealed sub-micron scale groups of 4-8 RyR clusters in healthy right ventricular myocytes. Myocytes studied from failing right ventricular myocytes revealed mixed population of larger RyR clusters and highly fragmented (smaller) clusters within the ‘hot spots’. We conclude that the structure-function correlative imaging offers an approach to locally examine the structural remodelling of RyR clusters that accompany changes in fast cytoplasmic Ca2+ signalling in cardiac pathology.</p>

<strong>Correlating electrical disfunction and structural remodeling in Arrhythmogenic Mouse Hearts by advanced optical methods</strong><br></p>
Severe remodeling processes may occur in the heart due to both genetic and non-genetic diseases. Structural remodeling, such as collagen deposition (fibrosis) and cellular misalignment, can affect electrical conduction at different orders of magnitude and, eventually, lead to arrhythmias. In this scenario, arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) is an inherited heart disease that involves ventricular dysfunction, arrhythmias and localized replacement of contractile fibers with fibrofatty scar tissue. Unfortunately, nowadays, predicting the impact of fine structural alterations on the electrical disfunction in entire organs is challenging, due to the inefficacy of standard imaging methods in performing high-resolution three-dimensional reconstructions in massive tissues.  In this work, we developed a new full-optical correlative approach to quantify and integrate the electrical dysfunctions with three-dimensional structural reconstructions of entire hearts, both in controls and in a mouse model of ACM. We combined optical mapping of the action potential propagation (APP) with advances in tissue clearing and light-sheet microscopy techniques. First, we employed an optical platform to map and analyze the APP in Langendorff-perfused hearts. Then, we optimized the SHIELD procedure for the clearing of cardiac tissue, thus converting the previously electrically characterized samples into well-preserved and fully-transparent specimens. A high-throughput light-sheet microscope has been developed following the mesoSPIM project: the conceived microscope allows the reconstruction of the whole mouse heart with micrometric resolution allowing fine quantification of myocytes alignment and fibrosis deposition across the organ. Finally, we developed a software pipeline that employs high-resolution 3D images to analyze and co-register APP maps with the 3D anatomy, contractile fibers disarray, and fibrosis deposition on each heart.  We believe that this promising methodological framework will allow clarifying the involvement of fine structural alterations in the electrical dysfunctions, thus enabling a unified investigation of the structural causes that lead to electrical and mechanical alterations after the tissue remodeling.</p>
