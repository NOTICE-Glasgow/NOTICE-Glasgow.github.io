<h2>Welcome to NOTICE Glasgow</h2>
<p>
NOTICE Glasgow is a small-scale symposium on Novel Optical Technology in Cardiac Electrophysiology and aims to create a synergy between the strongest proponents of optical imaging, microscopy and manipulation technology applied to investigating the heart. 
</p>

<p>
The workshop covers a broad range of topic from studying electrical activity, mechanical function and heart structure from the cellular scale to whole organ level. 
	Topics range from super resolution techniques to coarse-resolution whole heart mapping, from imaging cardiac
	activity and correlating this activity to underlying structure to manipulating cardiac activity with optogenetics. 
    </p>
    <p>
        NOTICE Glasgow is the second instalment, after our successful inauguration event 
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.notice.cnr.it/">NOTICE 2018</a> in Florence. 
    </p>

<h4>Scotland and the EU</h4>

    <p>
        Scotland has voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU and remains an open, vibrant and out-ward looking country. While Scottish weather is 
	notoriously unpredictable and we cannot guarantee a dry welcome, it will most certainly be warm.

My research interest is the  dynamics of networks of interconnected excitable cells, in particular information flow between cell and tissue levels of organization. I develop imaging and simulation methods to understand cardiac excitable systems over a range of space and time scales. I have collaborated on several imaging projects including fast remote focusing microscopy, temporal pixel multiplexing high speed imaging technologies, random access parallel microscopy, parallel light sheet microscopy, and applications of optogenetics to cardiac systems. </p>

 <strong>Erin Boland, Cardiovascular & Medical Sciences</strong><br>
I have been a part of the University of Glasgow for almost 9 years and have just completed my PhD in cardiovascular matrix biology focussing on collagen type IV mutations. I have also recently started a new position as a research assistant working with Professor Godfrey Smith investigating the effect of adrenergic signalling on cardiac conduction velocity. I’m very passionate about multi-disciplinary approaches to research and I have been very fortunate to have gained experience in a variety of topics ranging from molecular biology to now electrophysiology in my time at Glasgow. My long-term research interest is studying adverse remodelling in heart failure and how this impacts the molecular, morphological, and electrophysiological aspects of the heart in hopes of finding novel anti-fibrotic therapeutic approaches.</p>

 <strong>Eline Huethorst, Cardiovascular & Medical Sciences</strong><br>
Eline Huethorst started her academic career in the Netherlands with an undergraduate in Life Sciences from the University of Groningen and postgraduate in Regenerative Medicine from the University of Utrecht. Afterwards, she was awarded a 4-year PHD studentship by the British Heart Foundation to study the acute integration of small, engineered heart tissues (mm-scale) into the myocardium in the lab of Prof. Godfrey Smith at the University of Glasgow. She is now a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Glasgow and part of the BHF Centre for Regenerative Medicine consortium of universities within the UK, where the main goal is to investigate and eventually improve the electromechanical coupling of large, engineered heart tissues (cm-scale) with the host myocardium after implantation in vivo. She uses fluorescent dyes and PMTs or cameras with a high sampling rate to assess the electromechanical coupling after several weeks post-implantation. She further has experience with high-throughput imaging of physiological parameters of human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes, such as voltage, calcium and contractility.</p>

Currently, I am working as a Research Associate in Caroline group at the University of Glasgow and developing multi-photon imaging systems for heart visualization. My personal research goal is to develop imaging systems to observe and elucidate unknown biological and medical phenomena, and I believe that working on the current projects is a big step toward that goal!</p>

I am a physicist interested in engineering and building novel optical imaging systems for biomedical applications. I am especially interested in solutions to improving imaging speed and fidelity without disturbing the sample. Having completed my PhD from University of Exeter, I recently moved up north to join Caroline's group as a research assistant. My current project is focused on structural imaging of diseased mice heart. For this, I am building a mesoscale light sheet microscope called the mesoSPIM. This work will be complemented with functional imaging studies performed using a two-photon remote focusing microscope. I addition to tinkering with microscopes, the inter-disciplinary aspect of this project allows me to interact and collaborate with experts in their respective fields broadening my exposure to novel ideas and methodologies.</p>

 <strong>Steven Moreno, Physics & Astronomy</strong><br>
My name is Steven and I am in my second year of my PhD Project for Light Sheet Microscopy For Whole Heart Imaging In Health and Medicine. I graduated from Illinois Institute of Technology with a Bachelor in Science in Biomedical Engineering in 2019 and then graduated from the University of Glasgow with a Masters in Science in Biomedical Engineering in 2020. I am originally from El Paso, Texas in the United States and have always cherished my family and hometown where I grew up. Today, I am working with Dr. Caroline Muellenbroich on my PhD project within the Imaging Concepts Group here at the University of Glasgow. I have found this project to be one of the most enriching and awarding experiences I have had so far as the project has provided a practical use for my biomedical engineering background which blends biology, physics, problem solving, programming, medicine, and chemistry together to serve a greater purpose in the field of health. In addition to this, I am also concurrently serving as a Graduate Teaching Assistant here at the University and demonstrating undergraduate laboratory experiments for the School of Physics and Astronomy. The city of Glasgow and the country of Scotland have been so welcoming to me in the past few years and helped me get through the difficult time that was the pandemic. I have grown to love exploring both the city and countryside in my free time to see what they have to offer those who are willing to venture out.</p>
