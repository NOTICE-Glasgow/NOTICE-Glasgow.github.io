<h2>Our Code of Conduct</h2>

Thank you for visiting our code of conduct page- please read on.

    <p>
	We are committed to creating an environment that is diverse and supportive of all members of our research community. 
	Our goal is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse background possible and includes a 
	strong support of parents in science and the practice of baby wearing. We value a culture that is welcoming, friendly and safe for everyone, 
	and is inclusive of people of all races, ethnicities, genders, ages, abilities, religions (or lack thereof), sexual orientations, and appearances. 
	We expect that all conference attendees and other invited guests will behave in a professional and respectful manner. Discrimination or harassment 
	will not be tolerated. If you experience any problems during your visit or wish to share ideas or suggestions about these issues, we welcome your 
	feedback. Please reach out at any time by email or in person to Caroline Müllenbroich (caroline.muellenbroich_at_glasgow.ac.uk).  
    </p>

<li> Purpose
    <p>

A primary goal of NOTICE2020 is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. 
As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, 
socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof). This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, 
as well as the consequences for unacceptable behaviour. We invite all those who participate in NOTICE2020 to help us create safe and positive experiences 
for everyone.

    </p>
</li>


<li> Expected Behaviour
    <p>

The following behaviours are expected and requested of all community members:
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
    <li>Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.</li>
    <li>Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions. This means listening and not interrupting.</li>
    <li>Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behaviour and speech. Exercise kindness and inclusion. This should be a 
	place to meet new people and exchange ideas.</li>
    <li> NOTICE is a positive consent conference. This means that you should not touch another person without their verbal permission to do so.</li>
    <li>Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert conference organisers if you notice a
	dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.</li>
    <li>Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.</li>
    <li>Don’t be a jerk. Science is hard enough, be nice to each other.</li>
</ul>    
</p>
</li>




<li> Unacceptable Behaviour
    <p>

The following behaviours are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
    <li>Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.</li>
    <li>Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.</li>
    <li>Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.</li>
    <li>Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information ("doxing").</li>
    <li>Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.</li>
    <li>Inappropriate photography or recording of presentations or posters.</li>
    <li>Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone’s consent before touching them.</li>
    <li>Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.</li>
    <li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).</li>
    <li>Advocating for, or encouraging, or conspiring to hide any of the above behaviour.</li>
    <li>Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.</li>
    <li>Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcome sexual advances.</li>
</ul>   
 </p>
</li>


<li> Weapons Policy
    <p>
No weapons will be allowed at NOTICE2020 events, community spaces, or in other spaces covered by the scope of this Code of Conduct. 
Weapons include but are not limited to guns, explosives (including fireworks), and large knives such as those used for hunting or 
display, as well as any other item used for the purpose of causing injury or harm to others. Anyone seen in possession of one of 
these items will be asked to leave immediately, and will only be allowed to return without the weapon. Community members are further 
expected to comply with all state and local laws on this matter. Leave your class IV lasers in the lab.
    </p>
</li>


<li> Consequences of Unacceptable Behaviour
<p>
Unacceptable behaviour from any community member, including sponsors, speakers, volunteers and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. 
Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behaviour is expected to comply immediately. If an attendee engages in unacceptable behaviour, 
the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the 
conference without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).
    </p>
</li>


<li> Reporting Guidelines
    <p>

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behaviour, or have any other concerns, please notify a conference organiser as soon as possible (Contact caroline.muellenbroich.at.glasgow.ac.uk).

NOTICE2020's disciplinary policies are as follows: any organizer can issue a warning to any community member who has engaged in unacceptable behavior. 
If the behavioral issue persists, the organizers can vote to expel that person from the event without refund or reimbursement with a simple majority. 
A warning, if issued, is a courtesy, and the organizers can vote to expel any member from the event without refund or reimbursement without a warning if 
the organizers deems that the unacceptable behavior merits this action.

Additionally, the organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behaviour feel safe. 
In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.
 
Unacceptable behavior is grounds for being denied registration to future conferences or events.
</p>
</li>




<li> Addressing Grievances
    <p>
If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the organisers with a 
concise description of your grievance. The organizers will investigate the situation and respond accordingly.
    </p>
</li>




<li> Scope
    <p>
We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct  
at all times during the conference regardless of where you are physically located. To be clear, harassing somebody in the privacy of your own hotel room is still violating this code of conduct!
This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behaviour occuring outside the scope of community activities when such behaviour has the potential 
to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.
    </p>
