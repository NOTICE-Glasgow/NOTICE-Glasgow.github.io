<h2>Our Code of Conduct</h2>

Thank you for visiting our code of conduct page- please read on.

NOTiCE2023 is a conference that aims to inform and connect interdiscplinary scientists while offering an opportunity to network with your peers. We value the engagement of each attendee and work to ensure all participants have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. We want everyone to enjoy the conference and feel able to contribute. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the conference and at all conference events. All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at NOTiCE2023 are required to agree with the following code of conduct.

Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody. Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.

<h4>In brief</h4>

The NOTiCE2023 team is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference, including talks, panels, dinners, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be expelled from NOTiCE2023 and barred from future events.

<h4>The long version</h4>

Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value of our conference for everyone. Anyone who violates the Code of Conduct may be asked to leave, and may be barred from future events.
Harassment includes, but is not limited to:
 <ul>
  <li>Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, or technology choices.</li>
  <li>Sexual images or comments</li>
  <li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following.</li>
<li>Harassing photography or recording.</li>
<li>Sustained disruption of talks or other events.</li>
<li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
<li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.</li>
</ul> 

We expect you to:

 <ul>
  <li>Avoid negative comments, assumptions and stereotyping of people on the basis of their race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, nationality, class, disability, religion, beliefs, age, accent, culture, gender identity, gender expression or gender reassignment.</li>
  <li> Respect each other’s identities, names and pronouns at all times. Refer to speakers, chairs and attendees by the pronouns that they state. If you are unsure of the pronoun someone uses, ask them politely, or avoid gendered language, e.g. use “they” instead of “she” or “he”. Accept people’s self-identified gender at all times.</li>
  <li>Treat others with dignity and respect and to conduct yourselves in a proper and professional manner. All communication should be appropriate and be considerate of people from different cultural backgrounds. This includes recognising that some experiences may be different to your own.</li>
</ul> 
    
Remember that harassment and sexist, racist or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.  NOTiCE2023 is a trans inclusive group. Negative or exclusionary comments about any identity, including sexual orientation or gender identity should be reported to the organisers and/or chair as soon as possible, and will not be tolerated. Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately. Everyone is entitled to use whichever toilet they self-define as most appropriate for their gender identity and gender expression.

We expect participants to follow these rules throughout the conference at all venues, on all platforms and conference-related social events.

<h4>Reporting</h4>

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please contact a member of the organising committee as soon as possible, whether in-person or  <a target="_blank" href="https://forms.office.com/r/r4SNmNKhmz">via this form</a>. The NOTiCE2023 committee is the first point of contact to assist those experiencing harassment and we will do our best to help them feel safe for the duration of the conference. All reports are confidential. When taking a personal report, our staff will ensure this is confidential. They may involve other event staff to ensure your report is managed properly. During the reporting process, we’ll ask you to tell us about what happened. This can be upsetting, but we'll handle it as respectfully as possible. You won't be asked to confront anyone and we won't tell anyone who you are.
